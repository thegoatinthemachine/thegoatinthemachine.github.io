# Insatiable curiosity

I am Stewart Johnston, and I am what happens when a formally trained programmer
enjoys a career in Information Technology. My passion is to automate large IT
systems by any means at my disposal, and I will learn anything I need to do
this.

I have two github accounts, one personal and one academic:
- Personal: https://github.com/thegoatinthemachine/
- Academic: https://github.com/S-C-Johnston

On the personal github account is to be found more of the IT relevant work that
I've done which I had permission to share publicly, scrubbed of course of any
identifiable details. It is obviously lacking in anything proprietary I did not
have permission to share.

## Vimwiki

I've configured vimwiki to work with markdown, and the diary feature turns out
to be a pretty convenient way to deal with the _post/YYYY-MM-DD -> blog
structure that jekyll wants. Wiki [index](wiki/index.md)
