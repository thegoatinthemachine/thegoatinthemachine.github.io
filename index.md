# Always a work in progress

I'm Stewart. I'm enthusiastic about computers and solving problems with them. I
have enjoyed the latitude to design and implement solutions, and I can't go
back.

This revision of this site is obviously unstyled, basic html as generated from
markdown from jekyll courtesty of github pages. It's more important, at the
moment, to make it work. Then I'll make it good.
