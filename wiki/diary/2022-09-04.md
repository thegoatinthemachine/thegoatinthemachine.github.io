title: act for local development

## Using ``act`` for local development of the site

``act`` can be installed in both manjaro and macOS from their package
management. In manjaro, the default-installed tool ``pacman`` will work to pull
from the AUR. In macOS, ``brew`` will do the trick. Docker is a dependency.

But first

### Getting the correct github actions

the site needs to run on github actions explicitly. Github-pages started doing
this [transparently][gh_blog_pages_defaults_actions], in the background, in
August 2022. They [detailed][gh_blog_pages_actions_beta] some of this in July.
Hooray, that's easy to set up and because it was already doing this
transparently, using the defaults *should work*. By the time this post is live
on the site, this will already be true.

[gh_blog_pages_defaults_actions]: https://github.blog/2022-08-10-github-pages-now-uses-actions-by-default/
[gh_blog_pages_actions_beta]: https://github.blog/changelog/2022-07-27-github-pages-custom-github-actions-workflows-beta/

### A breakdown of what that does.

At time of writing, the version of github actions workflow at
.github/workflows/pages.yml does the following:

1. constructs build environment for "runner"s
2. checkout the codebase in the runner
3. configure jekyll in the runner
4. builds with jekyll and the other github-pages dependencies
5. tarballs and uploads the built artifacts to a server
6. unpacks and deploys the tarball to github-pages

### Resolving build errors

I set the repo to use the appropriate github action workflow, which by
definition involved copying their provided file to .github/workflows/pages.yml

``act`` will... act on this.

Running it the first couple times provides an error when it's running the build
step, configure-pages:

```bash
[Deploy Jekyll with GitHub Pages dependencies preinstalled/build]
[''] ‚≠ê Run Main Setup Pages
['']   üê≥  docker cp src=/root/.cache/act/actions-configure-pages@v2/ dst=/var/run/act/actions/actions-configure-pages@v2/
[''] close /tmp/act1858139433: file already closed
['']   üê≥  docker exec cmd=[node /var/run/act/actions/actions-configure-pages@v2/dist/index.js] user= workdir=
['']   üí¨  ::debug::all variables are set
| ::warning ::Get Pages site failed
| ::error ::Create Pages site failed
['']   ‚ùó  ::error::AxiosError: Request failed with status code 401
['']   ‚ùå  Failure - Main Setup Pages
[''] exitcode '1': failure
```

(Contents of brackets were all ditto the first, unnecessary visual clutter
removed) The resolution to this was plain as day in the readme at the act
[repository][gh_nektos_act]. I examined the action file, which the log tells me
should be in ~/.cache/act/actions-configure-pages@v2/action.yml and found under
inputs at line 14:

```yml
  token:
    description: 'GitHub token'
    default: ${{ github.token }}
    required: true
```

And so it is, I need to provide a Personal Access Token generated on github. I
created a dummy token to test this procedure, and discovered that for this to
work, at least sufficient permissions for workflows are necessary.

The next problem was that the artifact upload process was not finding an
environment variable it needed:

```bash
[''] ‚≠ê Run Main Upload artifact
['']   üê≥  docker cp src=/root/.cache/act/actions-upload-artifact@main/ dst=/var/run/act/actions/actions-upload-artifact@main/
[''] close /tmp/act834270224: file already closed
['']   üê≥  docker exec cmd=[node /var/run/act/actions/actions-upload-artifact@main/dist/index.js] user= workdir=
['']   üí¨  ::debug::followSymbolicLinks 'true'
['']   üí¨  ::debug::implicitDescendants 'true'
['']   üí¨  ::debug::omitBrokenSymbolicLinks 'true'
['']   üí¨  ::debug::followSymbolicLinks 'true'
['']   üí¨  ::debug::implicitDescendants 'true'
['']   üí¨  ::debug::omitBrokenSymbolicLinks 'true'
['']   üí¨  ::debug::Search path '/tmp/artifact.tar'
['']   üí¨  ::debug::File:/tmp/artifact.tar was found using the provided searchPath
| With the provided path, there will be 1 file uploaded
['']   üí¨  ::debug::Root artifact directory is /tmp

| Artifact name is valid!
['']   ‚ùó  ::error::Unable to get ACTIONS_RUNTIME_TOKEN env variable
['']   ‚ùå  Failure - Main Upload artifact
[''] exitcode '1': failure
['']   ‚ùå  Failure - Main Upload artifact
[''] exitcode '1': failure
```

Searching online thankfully brought me directly to the issue, the most recent
[comment][gh_act_issue_ACTION_TOKEN_env] on which provides the solution: add
``--artifact-server-path /tmp/artifacts`` to the arguments for act

[gh_act_issue_ACTION_TOKEN_env]: https://github.com/nektos/act/issues/329#issuecomment-1187246629

It now builds successfully.

I briefly ran into issues with running it with sudo, those being the
permissions of files generated. When I tried to resolve the later deploy
issues, one of the first articles I found on the internet suggested that it was
an issue of running as root instead of the user. That wasn't it, I think. But I
did come to understand that running with sudo created the built files and
artifacts with root ownership. So don't do that if possible.

### Resolving deploy errors

I can't. That's the end of my effort to get this particular angle to work.

The runners correctly output all the content of the site to a tarball in
/tmp/artifacts, and extracting that and pointing a simple http server (such as
``python3 -m http.server``) at it works fine. The deploy step, however, wants
to create and use OIDC tokens for a cloud consumer. It's hard for me to
identify what exactly is going on with the deploy action, since it's all
written for node, and I believe is using some core libraries from node.js, and
I just don't know it that well. What I suspect is that the token which github
actions creates on its own systems for its internal API calls is capable of
being assigned the idToken: write permission.

Although creating a PAT worked to resolve token issues earlier, that was just
the existence of a correctly formatted token. This is, from everything I've
read, a different ball of wax.

In any event, the deploy build step really wants to be pushing everything to
github-pages as an external source. I don't want that, I want precisely not
that. I can't immediately identify what the correct alchemy to make it go
locally without alteration to the source code of the actions is, and I don't
*really* want to read through a bunch of javascript in order to make that work,
of which there is no guarantee anyway.

### Next steps

What I *did* find of great utility, however, is that the action to build jekyll
includes instructions to pull down and/or build a docker container which has
the correct dependencies that github-pages uses. *This* is the nugget I was
after anyway. Github's official advice of "build it with jekyll locally!" does
not necessarily include the full list of included and whitelisted dependencies
for jekyll which github-pages supports.

Ultimately the goal of this is learning to build a fungible development
environment. Since I have the source code to deal with building a jekyll
environment which has parity with the actions which build my github pages site,
I'm going to do just that. Probably jenkins is the next best step.
