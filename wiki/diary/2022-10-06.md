## A different project distracted me

I got dug into a different project entirely. I want to create one set of files
for my resume, and filter out lines, bullet points, etc, from them as
appropriate. So of course I'm overcomplicating it and introducing containers
and a makefile and probably some unholy regex. It'll be fine, but it is causing
me to set aside the question of jenkins for this repo, temporarily.
